## Review
Documentation is very good, easy to setup 
followed [this tutorial](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/examples/create-react-app)

has it's own components, and attributes, seems okay , not a personal fan of the style though. 

## Will use `create-react-app` as a base
## Deployed
coming soon
